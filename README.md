# Devops
This repository documents my DevOps learning journey, covering key topics such as Linux, shell scripting, Git &amp; GitHub, CI/CD with Jenkins, cloud computing (AWS &amp; EC2), and containerization with Docker &amp; Kubernetes. I'll be sharing scripts, configurations, and automation workflows as I progress!
